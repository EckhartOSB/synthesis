<h1>Function GotToolkit</h1>
<div id="intro">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This function allows you to determine whether the Synergy/DE UI Toolkit
was linked or opened by this application, as well as whether it has been started.
It also provides the ability to attach to the UI Toolkit if it isn't attached, and
to start it if it isn't started.</p>
</div>
<div class="ref">
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<pre><code>
	<em>result</em> = GotToolkit([<em>option</em>])
</code></pre> 
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>result</em> is a flag indicating the state of the Toolkit following this call (^val).
      Values are defined in synthesis.def:
    <ul>
      <li>D_NO_TOOLKIT - The Toolkit is not attached to this application.</li>
      <li>D_TOOLKIT_AVAILABLE - The Toolkit is attached, but not started.</li>
      <li>D_TOOLKIT_STARTED - The Toolkit has been started.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><em>option</em> is an optional flag indicating what action to take (n).  Values are defined
      in synthesis.def:
      <ul>
        <li>D_NO_START (or not passed) - Don't change anything.</li>
	<li>D_START - Start the Toolkit if it is already attached.</li>
	<li>D_START_ANYWAY - Start the Toolkit, attaching to it first if needed.</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="ref">
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>
If instructed to attach to the Toolkit, GotToolkit uses OPENELB and assumes that the Toolkit
library is "WND:tklib.elb" on all platforms except OpenVMS, where it expects the symbol
"TKLIB_SH" to point to it instead.  If instructed to start the UI Toolkit, GotToolkit calls
U_START with no parameters.  Calling U_START has a number of side-effects, such as closing all
channels.  Also, since GotToolkit must use xsubr to call U_START, it's possible to inject
an overloaded version of U_START by giving another library priority over tklib.elb.
