<h1>Class Oi</h1>
<div id="intro">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This class provides a mechanism for mapping objects to integers, and vice versa.
Its name, "Oi," is short for "Object integer."</p>
<p>Synergy/DE, being a type-safe language, is not friendly to the idea of passing an
object as a parameter where a primitive type is expected.  Nor can you pass a record
or group that contains an object.  Thus, a disconnect can easily occur when  you wish
to use an object in a routine that must be called back from a mechanism where only
primitives can be passed.</p>
<p>The obvious solution to this problem is to keep an array of the objects you need
to reference, and pass their indices instead of their references.  Care must be taken
to keep the indices from changing as objects are added or removed.  That's what this
class encapsulates.</p>
<p>Naturally, adding an object to this mechanism creates a reference, so you must be
careful to "drop" an object from Oi when you no longer need it.  Oi will reuse that
index of its internal array.</p>

<h2>Explanation of symbols used</h2>
<p>
Words in italics indicate an instance of a class.  The word corresponds to the class name, except where
more than one instance is represented in the same statement.  In that case a number (2, 3, etc.) is appended
to the class name.</p>
<p>
Words in normal typeface are to be taken literally (required punctuation, class name in a static reference,
method name, etc.)</p>
<p>The symbol =&gt; is used to separate an expression (on the left) from its return value (on the right).</p>
<p>An ellipsis (...) indicates that the previous argument may be repeated any number of times.  The
description will indicate whether one instance is required.</p>

    <h3>static method drop</h3>

    <div class="description">
      <p>
        This method removes an object from Oi.  Any index for that object previously retrieved via
	<a href="#ref-o2i">o2i</a> will no longer be valid.
      </p>
      <p>If <em>object</em> is passed, that object (if tracked by Oi) will be removed.  If that object
      is not currently tracked by Oi, nothing happens.</p>
      <p>If <em>int</em> is passed, then the object whose index is <em>int</em> will be removed.  If
      the index is not valid, nothing happens.</p>

      Oi.i2o(<em>int</em>) =&gt; <em>object</em>
    </code>
    <div class="description">
      <p>
        This method returns the object whose Oi integer value is <em>int</em>, or ^null if <em>int</em>
	does not correspond to an object currently being tracked by Oi.

      <p>
	This method returns an integer that uniquely identifies <em>object</em> within Oi.  If Oi is
	already tracking the object in question, its index will be returned.  If not, the object will
	be added to Oi's internal array and the new index will be returned.  The index of previously
	dropped objects may be reused.  The value will be in the range of 0 through the number of objects
	currently being tracked by Oi minus one.
