<h1>Abstract Class Transport</h1>
<div id="intro">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This class represents a serial transport mechanism.  Its primary reason for existing is to
provide an abstraction above <a href="socket.html">Socket</a> for use by the
<a href="telnet.html">Telnet</a> class, since the telnet protocol
does not strictly require sockets as its transport mechanism.  For instance, it is theoretically
possible to conduct a Telnet session over HTTP, a pipe, or even smoke signals -- provided an
encoding of characters 0-255.</p>
<p>This abstract class only provides two methods, Send and Receive.  We do not presume
characteristics of the relationship between the sender and the receiver such as 
client/server, peer-to-peer, out/in process, or threading.  It is expected that
derived classes will add members to establish connections and control options.</p>

<h2>Explanation of symbols used</h2>
<p>
Words in italics indicate an instance of a class.  The word corresponds to the class name, except where
more than one instance is represented in the same statement.  In that case a number (2, 3, etc.) is appended
to the class name.</p>
<p>
Words in normal typeface are to be taken literally (required punctuation, class name in a static reference,
method name, etc.)</p>
<p>The symbol =&gt; is used to separate an expression (on the left) from its return value (on the right).</p>
<p>An ellipsis (...) indicates that the previous argument may be repeated any number of times.  The
description will indicate whether one instance is required.</p>

    <h3>abstract method Receive</h3>
    <code>
      <em>transport</em>.Receive(<em>a</em>) =&gt; <em>i</em>
    </code>
    <div class="description">
        This method receives data from a sender on the other end of the connection, returning that data in
	the parameter <em>a</em>, which must be writable.  It is expected that the data will be limited to the size of <em>a</em>.
	The method returns the number of characters returned in <em>a</em>.
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="ref-send" class="ref">
    <h3>abstract method Send</h3>
    <code>
      <em>transport</em>.Send(<em>a</em>) =&gt; <em>boolean</em>
    </code>
    <div class="description">
      This method sends the characters in <em>a</em> to the receiver on the other end of the connection.
      It returns true if successful, or false to indicate a failure.  There is no presumption that the receiver
      has actually received the data yet, merely that the send did not fail.
